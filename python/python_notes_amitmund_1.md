### Finding type
```python
name = "Foo"
print (type(name == str))
```

output:
```
<class 'bool'>
```

```

output:
```
True
```

### String Concatenate

```
+ is also used to concatenate String values:
```

### Type Casting

```python
age = int("20")
print(age)

fraction = 0.1
intFraction = int(fraction)

print(intFraction)
```

output:
```
20
0
```

==
!=
>
<
>=
<=
```


```python
a = 1
b = 2
print (a == b) #False
print (a != b) #True
print (a > b )#False
print (a <= b) #True
```

### Boolean Operators


```python
not
and
or
```

```python

# or
print(0 or 1) ## 1
print(False or 'hey') ## 'hey'
print('hi' or 'hey') ## 'hi'
print([] or False) ## 'False'
print(False or []) ## '[]'

# and
print(0 and 1) ## 0
print(1 and 0) ## 0
print(False and 'hey') ## False
print('hi' and 'hey') ## 'hey'
print([] and False ) ## []
print(False and [] ) ## False

```

### Bitwise Operators

```python
& : performs binary AND
| : performs binary OR
^ : performs a binary XOR operation
~ : performs a binary NOT operation
<< : shift left operation
>> : shift right operation
```
