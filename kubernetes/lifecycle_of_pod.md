- Pending 

    - Pod is waiting to be `scheduled` and the `worker node is already assigned`. The images of its containers are pulled and started, it remains in this phase.

- Running 
    - A Pod is to be in the `running` phase, when it's `linkedin to a node`, and `all the containers are active`.

- `Succeeded`
    - All Containers in the Pod have `terminated successfully`, and will not be restarted.

- Failed
    - All container(s) of the Pod have exited and at least one container has returned non-zero status.


- Unknown
    - The state of the pod is shown as `unknown`, when the `kubelet` stops reporting to the API server.

- CrashLoopBack
    - The container fails to start and is tried again and again.


- Terminated

The podâ€™s status field is a PodStatus object, which has a phase field.
